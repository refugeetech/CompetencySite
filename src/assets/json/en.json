  "intro": "We want to show the available competence within the group of migrants and asylum seekers in Sweden today. The purpose is to inspire for new jobs to be created. We also cooperate with other initiatives such as JustArrived and LinkedIn to increase the speed in the process.\n\nThe Competency project is paused for now while we wait for new opportunities. Registration is therefore not possible. If you are curious about the project please feel free to contact us!",
