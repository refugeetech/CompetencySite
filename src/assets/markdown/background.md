### Background
This project is the result of a process led by Refugee Tech and initially created on a weekend Kodapor X Hackathon in February 2016. The team consists mainly of developers with no or little knowledge of the migration process in detail, therefore there might be a lot of things we miss, have misunderstood or underestimated. We have the ambition to make the project sustainable by itself in the future and for both reasons we need all the help we can get to get the project as accurate and successfull as possible. Please contact us if you have any input or feedback.
