## Our goal

We want to speed up the integration process for all refugees by visualizing their talent

Hereâ€™s a platform for asylum seekers where they can register their competency and their contact information. The service will be available in multiple languages.

The employers can easily see what available competency there is available in their area. There will also be an easy way of contacting multiple people with job offerings and internships.
The diagrams will show the general public and authorities how diverse the group of asylum seekers really are. We hope this will make people understand that we shouldn't only talk about the cost of integration but also what opportunities that are open for those who start seeing this potential.

By shortening the time from arrival to getting a job is a hugely beneficial task for us. Every day we can save have tripple effect in cost savings, tax income, social and humanitarian perspectives. Our government organisations are struggling to keep up and have difficulties to coordinate an effective process. We want to help by creating a new way to short-circuit the whole process by exposing everyone interested in an internship or job as soon as they have a LMA-card (temporary working permit).
